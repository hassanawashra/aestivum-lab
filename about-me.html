            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Background: Why Agronomy?</h3>
                <p>Coming from a developing country that relies on importing to supply the community with the essential food have made me concerning about food security and the situation of the community.</p>
                <p>Agronomy was my chosen way of contributing to improving food security levels by helping the production meeting the consumption.</p>
                <p>Worked for 1 year as an agronomist for a farm, focusing on pest management techniques and agricultural practices of protected and outdoor crops.</p>
                <p>Worked for 2 years as a freelancer agronomist, providing consulting services for household farmers to improved crop production and protection by applying feasible and sustainable solutions.</p>
                <p>All the experience I gained and challenges I faced have made me wondering what is happening inside, at the Molecular Level?</p>
                <p>This curiosity have shifted me from dreaming to be a traditional agronomist, to be a researcher in the field of crop protection and work in the applied research for real-world solutions.</p>

                <h3>Educational Excellence</h3>
                <p>Won the highly-competitive DPET scholarship to do MSc in Plant Biotechnology and Enterprise at Durham University. This scholarship covered the tuition fees, lab bench money, and all life expenses for my time in Durham.</p>
                <p>The course involved 5 taught modules in addition to an extensive research project, in which I spent 6 months working full-time in a well-established molecular biology and biochemistry lab.</p>
                <p>I got a distinction for my research project and a merit for the degree.</p>
                <p>2017-2020 horticulture and agronomy, with focus on plant pathology (downy mildew on cucumber) and pest management.</p>
                <p>During those three years, I have been participating in workshops, touring farms.</p>

                <h3>Research Experience</h3>
                <p>Experienced in conducting research using molecular biology and biochemistry techniques, including but not limited to PCR, gene-cloning, animal and plant gene and protein expression techniques along with antibody work including immunoblotting and confocal microscopy.</p>
                <p>“My research project was focused on the plant-pathogen interaction by studying post-translational modifications of a pattern recognition receptor called CERK1, which is responsible for the detection of pathogenic fungus by detecting chitin. Arabidopsis thaliana was used as a model plant and botrytis cinerea was used as a model fungus. The research findings were interesting as they contribute to the gap in the field of pathogen detection by plant cell, and will be published as soon as the rest of the work is done by current lab members (expected mid 2025)”</p>
                <p>Worked for 8 months in consulting and conducted three research-based projects in the fields of rural development, agribusiness, and public health.</p>
